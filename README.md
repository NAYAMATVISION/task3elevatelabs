🧠 Linear Regression - House Price Prediction

📌 Task Overview
This project aims to implement Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models using a housing price dataset to understand how different features impact the price of a house.

🎯 Objectives
Understand how linear regression works.
Preprocess and analyze real-world data.
Build and evaluate regression models using Scikit-learn.
Visualize and interpret results and metrics.

🗃️ Dataset Used
📂 Dataset Name: Housing Price Prediction
🔗 Source: Kaggle - Housing Price Dataset

The dataset includes features like:

Area

Bedrooms

Bathrooms

Furnishing status (Furnished/Semi-furnished/Unfurnished)

Parking

Location

Price (target)

| Tool           | Purpose                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `Pandas`       | Data analysis & manipulation |
| `Matplotlib`   | Plotting & visualizations    |
| `Seaborn`      | Data visualization           |
| `Scikit-learn` | Machine Learning modeling    |
| `Jupyter`      | Development environment      |

💬 Key Learnings
Linear Regression is a powerful yet simple method for understanding relationships between features and a continuous target.

Proper preprocessing (encoding, scaling, splitting) is crucial for performance.

Model evaluation metrics help us decide whether the model is reliable.

Interpretability is one of the biggest advantages of linear regression.
